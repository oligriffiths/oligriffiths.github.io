title: 08-Live Reload

Well, obviously in dev we'd quite like to not have to hit refresh all the time, because developers are,
well, we're lazy. So we can use a live reload server to do the job for us.

```sh
yarn add --dev broccoli-livereload@^1.3.0
```

```js
// Brocfile.js
const funnel = require('broccoli-funnel');
const merge = require('broccoli-merge-trees');
const compileSass = require('broccoli-sass-source-maps')(require('sass'));
const Rollup = require("broccoli-rollup");
const LiveReload = require('broccoli-livereload');
const babel = require("rollup-plugin-babel");
const nodeResolve = require('rollup-plugin-node-resolve');
const commonjs = require('rollup-plugin-commonjs');

const appRoot = "app";

// Copy HTML file from app root to destination
const html = funnel(appRoot, {
  files: ["index.html"],
  annotation: "Index file",
});

// Compile JS through rollup
let js = new Rollup(appRoot, {
  inputFiles: ["**/*.js"],
  annotation: "JS Transformation",
  rollup: {
    input: "app.js",
    output: {
      file: "assets/app.js",
      format: "iife",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
    plugins: [
      nodeResolve({
        jsnext: true,
        browser: true,
      }),
      commonjs({
        include: 'node_modules/**',
      }),
      babel({
        exclude: "node_modules/**",
      }),
    ],
  }
});

// Copy CSS file into assets
const css = compileSass(
  [appRoot],
  'styles/app.scss',
  'assets/app.css',
  {
    sourceMap: true,
    sourceMapContents: true,
    annotation: "Sass files"
  }
);

// Copy public files into destination
const public = funnel('public', {
  annotation: "Public files",
});

// Remove the existing module.exports and replace with:
let tree = merge([html, js, css, public], {annotation: "Final output"});

// Include live reaload server
tree = new LiveReload(tree, {
  target: 'index.html',
});

module.exports = tree;
```

What we're doing here is assigning the final output of `Merge` to a mutable variable `tree`, then passing that into the
`LiveReload` plugin, that will auto-inject the Live Reload javascript and setup the server file watcher.

Now `yarn serve`, try changing a `scss` file, notice how the css refreshes in place, no browser refresh. Change a
`.js` or `.html` file and the page will refresh. This doesn't support fancy hot reloading like React and Webpack does,
but that's a slightly different ballgame, and is very architecture dependent.
